### Objective
* "For this lab, you are going to get acquainted with Node.js, or simply known as Node. Node is a server environment that allows you to run JS on the server-side. This can streamline your development process since you are using the same language on both the client as well as the server. As well, Node.js comes with a plethora of modules for various features."

### What I Learned
* Starting this lab was frustrating at first since Node.js's a new language and I can't easily see it like HTML or CSS; but after seeing my professor's examples in lectures it made more sense.
* I learned that Node virtually maps file folder systems.
