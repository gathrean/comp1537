      <h2>blond</h2>
      <h3>August 20, 2016</h3>
      <p> <b><i>Blonde</i></b> (alternatively titled blond) is the second studio album by American singer <i>Frank
          Ocean</i>.
        It was released as a timed exclusive on the <i>iTunes Store</i> and <i>Apple Music</i>,

      <p>
        The album features guest vocals from <i>André 3000</i>, <i>Beyoncé</i>, and <i>Burrell</i>, among
        others.
        Production was handled by Ocean himself, alongside a variety of high-profile record producers,
        including Malay and Om'Mas Keith, who collaborated with Ocean on Channel Orange,
        as well as James Blake, Jon Brion, Buddy Ross, Pharrell Williams, and

      <h2>ENDLESS</h2>
      <h3>August 19, 2016</h3>
      <p> <b><i>Endless</i></b> is a visual album by American singer Frank Ocean.
        It was released as an exclusive streaming-only video on Apple Music,
        and preceded the August 20 release of Ocean's second studio album Blonde. Endless was later
        remastered and had a limited reissue in physical audio and visual formats on April 10, 2018.
      </p>
      <p>
        The album followed a period of controversy for Ocean, who was in a highly publicized battle with Def Jam
        Recordings,
        and it was the subject of widespread media discussion upon release. Endless was recorded in various
        studios across California,
        as well as in London, Miami, and Berlin, with production handled primarily by Ocean, Vegyn, Michael
        Uzowuru, and Troy Noka;
        Ocean previously collaborated with Noka on his debut mixtape, Nostalgia, Ultra (2011).

      <h2>channel ORANGE</h2>
      <h3>July 10, 2012</h3>
      <p>
        <b><i>Channel Orange</i></b> (stylized as channel ORANGE) is the debut studio album by American R&B
        singer-songwriter
        Frank Ocean.
        It was released by Def Jam Recordings. After releasing his mixtape Nostalgia, Ultra
        the previous year,
        Ocean began writing new songs with Malay, a producer and songwriter who then assisted him with recording
        Channel Orange at
        EastWest Studios in Hollywood.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather than rely on samples as he had with his mixtape, Ocean wanted to approach sound and song
        structure differently on the album. Other producers who worked on the album included Om'Mas Keith and
        Pharrell Williams.
        Its recording also featured guest appearances from Odd Future rappers Earl Sweatshirt and Tyler, the
        Creator, vocalist/songwriter
        André 3000, and guitarist John Mayer.

      <h2>nostalgia, ULTRA.</h2>
      <h3>February 16, 2011</h3>
      <p>
        <b><i>Nostalgia Ultra</i></b> (stylized as nostalgia,ULTRA. and occasionally nostalgia/ultra) is the
        debut mixtape by
        American singer-songwriter Frank Ocean. He was inspired to make the mixtape after
        Hurricane Katrina in his native
        New Orleans and his subsequent relocation to Los Angeles.
      <p>
        After joining alternative hip hop group Odd Future in 2010, he self-released the mixtape, without
        initial promotion.
        Nostalgia, Ultra has a unique R&B aesthetic and features surreal themes and nostalgic lyrics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The songs mostly focus on interpersonal relationships, personal reflection, and social commentary.
        Following its release, the mixtape
        received rave reviews from music critics. The cover features a picture of a bright orange BMW E30 M3,
        Ocean's "dream car", in plain sight
        amidst lush greenery.
