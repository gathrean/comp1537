### Objective
* "You can use other layout techniques such as float and clear and change the value of the display property. However, you must use media queries and you must use CSS grid as how we went over in lecture."


### What I Learned
* I learned how to set up grids and also how crucial they are in web pages. Without pages, a lot of pages now would either be just one column or relying on HTML tables.
* Figuring out CSS grids without visualizing them with a simulator can help a ton. 
* This video helped me understand grids initially: https://youtu.be/68O6eOGAGqA
* With a deeper understanding of HTML and CSS, I can have a general idea of how a website should be designed
