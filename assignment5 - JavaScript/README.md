# comp1537 Assignment 5
* November 22, 2022
* 100% Complete 

### Objective
* "To build the basic architecture of a web app – minus the DB (i.e., data tier)."
* "For this assignment, you are going to develop the basic constructs of a web app. This will include a front- end as well as a back-end. For now, no DB. So far, you’ve been shown Node.js, Express.js (and how to route), the HTTP methods (GET, POST), and how to download modules with NPM. Now it’s time to create something that demonstrates an applied use of them together. You are going to create both a front-end, as well as a back-end (via Node.js)."

### What I Learned
* Everything is now adding up. I reused my assignment from Assignment 4 to save time (it's almost Finals week).
* I learned to use AJAX calls to return files from the file system (one file is HTML and one file is JSON). Both the HTML and JSON call returned 10 records with five attributes.
* I learned how to insert a DOM into the main HTML page document.
* I learned how to pull content from my own server (photos in folder and call it in the HTML instead of linking an URL to another website's photo, etc).
* This might be my best looking CSS design (as of November 2022)
